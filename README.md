## üîÑ MCP Protocol

The server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification, providing a standardized interface for AI models to interact with Kick's services:

### Key Components
- **JSON-RPC Communication**: All interactions use JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout
- **Tool Definitions**: Comprehensive set of tools for Kick API interaction
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses and retry logic
- **Authentication**: Secure OAuth 2.0 flow for API access

### Protocol Flow
1. Model sends JSON-RPC request via stdin
2. Server processes request and calls Kick API
3. Server sends JSON-RPC response via stdout
4. Model receives response and continues processing

### Example Protocol Exchange
```json
// Model Request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getUserProfile",
  "params": {
    "access_token": "user_access_token"
  },
  "id": 1
}

// Server Response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "username": "example_user",
    "profile_picture": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
    "followers": 1000
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

## üí° Use Cases

3. **A Kick API Key** (Your Special Access Card)
   - Go to [Kick Developer Portal](https://kick.com/developer)
   - Click "Sign Up" if you don't have an account
   - Click "Create New Application"
   - Fill in the form (like registering for a new account)
   - You'll get three important pieces:
     - `client_id` (like your username)
     - `client_secret` (like your password)
     - `api_key` (your main access card)

### üì• Installation (Like Following a Recipe)

#### Option 1: Using Smithery (Easiest Way)
```bash
# Copy and paste this into your terminal

## üîß Kick App Setup

To use this MCP server with Kick, you'll need to create a Kick app:

1. **Enable 2FA**
   - Go to your Kick Account Settings
   - Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
   - This is required to access the developer tools

2. **Create Your Kick App**
   - Go to your Account Settings
   - Navigate to the Developer tab
   - Click "Create New App"
   - Fill in the following details:
     - Name: "Kick MCP Server"
     - Description: "A Model Context Protocol server for Kick API integration"
     - Redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Click "Create App"
   - Save your `client_id` and `client_secret`

3. **Configure Your Environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the following variables:
     ```
     KICK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     KICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
     KICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     KICK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
     ```

4. **Verify Your Setup**
   - Start the server: `npm run mcp`
   - Test authentication:
     ```json
     {
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "method": "getOAuthUrl",
       "params": {
         "client_id": "your_client_id",
         "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:3000/auth/callback",
         "scope": "user:read channel:read"
       },
       "id": 1
     }
     ```

## üîê Authentication Made Simple

### üîë What is Authentication?
Think of authentication like a special key card system:
- Your app needs a key card (access token) to enter Kick's building
- The key card has different access levels (scopes)
- The key card expires after a while and needs to be renewed

### üìù Getting Your First Access Token (Like Getting Your Key Card)

1. **Get Your Developer Credentials**
   - Go to [Kick Developer Portal](https://kick.com/developer)
   - Click "Create New Application"
   - Fill in the form:
     - Name: Your app's name
     - Description: What your app does
     - Website: Your app's website
   - You'll get three important pieces:
     - `client_id` (like your employee ID)
     - `client_secret` (like your PIN number)
     - `api_key` (your main access card)

2. **Get an OAuth URL** (Like Requesting Access)
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "getOAuthUrl",
     "params": {
       "client_id": "your_client_id",
       "redirect_uri": "https://your-app.com/callback",
       "scope": "user:read channel:read"
     },
     "id": 1
   }
   ```

   | Parameter | What it is | Example | Why it's needed |
   |-----------|------------|---------|-----------------|
   | `client_id` | Your app's ID | `abc123def456` | So Kick knows which app is asking |
   | `redirect_uri` | Where to go after login | `https://your-app.com/callback` | Where to send the user after they approve |
   | `scope` | What your app can do | `user:read channel:read` | What permissions your app needs |

3. **Get Your Access Token** (Like Getting Your Key Card)
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "getAccessToken",
     "params": {
       "client_id": "your_client_id",
       "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
       "code": "code_from_kick",
       "redirect_uri": "https://your-app.com/callback"
     },
     "id": 2
   }
   ```

   | Parameter | What it is | Example | Why it's needed |
   |-----------|------------|---------|-----------------|
   | `client_id` | Your app's ID | `abc123def456` | To identify your app |
   | `client_secret` | Your app's secret | `xyz789uvw012` | To prove it's really your app |
   | `code` | Temporary code | `auth_code_123` | The code Kick gave you |
   | `redirect_uri` | Same as before | `https://your-app.com/callback` | Must match what you used before |

### üîÑ Using Your Access Token (Like Using Your Key Card)

1. **Make Your First API Call**
   ```bash
   # This is like showing your key card to enter
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
        https://kick.com/api/v2/user/profile
   ```

2. **What to Do When Your Token Expires** (Like Renewing Your Key Card)
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "refreshAccessToken",
     "params": {
       "client_id": "your_client_id",
       "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
       "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
     },
     "id": 3
   }
   ```

### üîç Understanding Scopes (Like Access Levels)

Scopes are like different areas your key card can access:

| Scope | What it lets you do | Example Use | Like Having Access To... |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `user:read` | See user information | Show user profile | The user directory |
| `channel:read` | See channel details | Display channel info | The channel listings |
| `channel:write` | Change channel settings | Update stream title | The control room |
| `chat:write` | Send chat messages | Create chat bot | The chat system |
| `streamkey:read` | Get stream URLs | Show stream link | The streaming room |
| `events:subscribe` | Get notifications | Alert when stream starts | The notification system |

### ‚ùì Common Questions (Like FAQ)

1. **How long do tokens last?**
   - Access tokens: Usually 1 hour (like a temporary pass)
   - Refresh tokens: Much longer (like a permanent ID card)

2. **What if my token stops working?**
   - Try refreshing it (like renewing your pass)
   - If that doesn't work, get a new one (like getting a new ID card)

3. **How do I know what scopes I need?**
   - Start with just what you need (like only requesting access to the rooms you'll use)
   - Add more as your app grows (like requesting access to more rooms later)
   - Check the API documentation for required scopes (like reading the building rules)

4. **What if I make a mistake?**
   - Check the error message (like reading the sign on the door)
   - Make sure your credentials are correct (like checking your ID card)
   - Try the steps again (like going through the process again)
