dispatchMCP({
  tool: 'kick.banUser',
  params: { username: 'baduser', reason: 'Banned word or spam detected' }
});
```

### 2. Custom Alert for New Follower
```js
onKickEvent('follow', (user) => {
  sendAlert(`Thanks for following, ${user.username}!`);
  // Optionally trigger an OBS overlay or sound
});
```

### 3. Interactive Chat Bot Command
```js
onKickCommand('!weather', async (location, user) => {
  const weather = await mcpTool('web.search', { query: `weather in ${location}` });
  sendMessage(user, `Current weather: ${weather.snippet}`);
});
```

### 4. Scheduled Stream Title Change
```js
scheduleTask('0 18 * * *', () => {
  dispatchMCP({
    tool: 'kick.updateStreamTitle',
    params: { title: 'Evening Stream - Let\'s Go!' }
  });
});
```

## MCP Integration with Smithery.ai

This project supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extending capabilities through Smithery.ai servers. Below are updated instructions based on the MCP configuration in `mcp.json`, ensuring compatibility with Windows systems.

### Connecting MCP Servers
To connect MCP servers using Smithery.ai, follow these steps. This is based on the JSON configuration example in `mcp.json`:

1. **Understand MCP Configuration**: The `mcp.json` file in the project root defines server setups. Here's the standard format:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": [
       {
         "name": "server-sequential-thinking",
         "command": "cmd /c npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking --key a6f8d215-b80d-4521-8d8d-bdeaa6384b02",
         "description": "A tool for dynamic problem-solving"
       },
       {
         "name": "brave-search",
         "command": "cmd /c npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @smithery-ai/brave-search --key a6f8d215-b80d-4521-8d8d-bdeaa6384b02",
         "description": "Web search capabilities"
       }
       // Add more servers as needed, ensuring the command uses CMD for Windows compatibility
     ]
   }
   ```
   Each server entry includes a name, Windows-compatible CMD command for installation via NPX, and a description.

2. **Installation via CMD or NPX**:
   - Install MCP servers using the commands in `mcp.json`. For example:
     ```
     cmd /c npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking --key a6f8d215-b80d-4521-8d8d-bdeaa6384b02
     ```
     - Replace the key with your Smithery.ai-provided key.
     - For multiple installations, run commands sequentially or automate with a batch script for efficiency.

3. **In Cursor AI**:
   - Integrate MCP servers in Cursor AI by adding them to the AI settings. Reference `mcp.json` for server details. Use tools like `use_mcp_tool` or `access_mcp_resource` in your code, ensuring the Smithery.ai key is handled securely. For Cursor AI setup, consult Smithery.ai documentation to register servers and enable features.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys to enhance security.
   - Keep MCP servers updated through Smithery.ai to leverage new capabilities and fixes.
   - Store additional context in `docs/context.md` if needed for advanced configurations.
   - Follow documentation best practices by keeping instructions clear, version-agnostic, and easy to follow.

For any issues, refer to the project code, `docs/context.md`, or create a GitHub issue.

## Configuration

This application requires certain environment variables for proper configuration, especially for security features.

### Token Encryption Key (`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)

- **Purpose**: This key is crucial for encrypting sensitive authentication tokens stored persistently (e.g., in `data/auth-store.enc`). It ensures that tokens are not stored in plain text, enhancing security.
- **Requirement**: The `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` **MUST** be a **64-character hexadecimal string** (representing 32 bytes of data). This is required for the AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm used.
- **Generation**: You can generate a secure key using tools like OpenSSL:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
- **Security**:
    - **Treat this key as highly sensitive.** Keep it secret and secure.
    - **DO NOT commit this key directly into version control.**
    - Use environment variables or a `.env` file (ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore`) to provide this key to the application. See `.env.example` for structure.
- **Consequences of Missing/Invalid Key**:
    - If the `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is missing or not a valid 64-character hex string, the application will log a **CRITICAL error** on startup.
    - For development purposes only, it might fall back to an insecure, randomly generated key, but this is **NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION**. Any data encrypted with the default key will be lost if the application restarts without a proper key set.
- **Consequences of Changing the Key**:
    - If you change the `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` after data has been stored, the application **will not be able to decrypt the existing stored data**. This will result in users needing to re-authenticate. Plan key rotations carefully.
