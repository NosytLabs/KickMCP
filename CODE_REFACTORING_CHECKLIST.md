# Code Refactoring Checklist

## File Naming and Organization Issues

- [ ] 1. Fix `src/services/kick/BaseKickService.ts`
  * Current location: `src/services/kick/`
  * Current line count: 162
  * Issues:
    - Contains both API request logic and caching logic
    - Mixes HTTP request handling with business logic
    - Has hardcoded cache configuration
  * Actions required:
    - Extract caching logic to a separate service
    - Move HTTP request handling to a dedicated utility
    - Create configuration file for cache settings
  * Complexity: High

- [ ] 2. Fix `src/utils/kickApiErrorHandler.ts`
  * Current location: `src/utils/`
  * Current line count: 187
  * Issues:
    - Misleading location in utils folder despite being Kick API specific
    - Contains both error mapping and error handling logic
  * Actions required:
    - Move to: `src/services/kick/errors/`
    - Split into separate files: `errorCodes.ts`, `errorMapper.ts`, and `errorHandler.ts`
    - Update imports in related files
  * Complexity: Medium

- [ ] 3. Fix `src/utils/mcp-inspector.ts`
  * Current location: `src/utils/`
  * Current line count: 161
  * Issues:
    - Inconsistent file naming (uses hyphen instead of camelCase)
    - Contains both MCP compatibility checks and diagnostics
  * Actions required:
    - Rename to: `mcpInspector.ts`
    - Split into `mcpCompatibility.ts` and `mcpDiagnostics.ts`
    - Update imports in related files
  * Complexity: Medium

## Oversized Components

- [ ] 4. Refactor `src/services/kick/StreamService.ts`
  * Current line count: 205
  * Issues:
    - Too many responsibilities (stream management, polls, stats)
    - Contains error handling logic that should be centralized
    - Many unverified API endpoints with comments indicating uncertainty
  * Actions required:
    - Extract poll functionality into `PollService.ts`
    - Extract stream stats into `StreamStatsService.ts`
    - Verify and document API endpoints
    - Use centralized error handling
  * Complexity: High

- [ ] 5. Refactor `src/services/kick/UserService.ts`
  * Current line count: 166
  * Issues:
    - Contains multiple user-related functionalities
    - Many unverified API endpoints with comments indicating uncertainty
  * Actions required:
    - Extract user subscription logic to `SubscriptionService.ts`
    - Extract user wallet/gifts to `UserWalletService.ts`
    - Verify and document API endpoints
  * Complexity: Medium

- [ ] 6. Refactor `src/services/kick/ChatService.ts`
  * Current line count: 155
  * Issues:
    - Mixes chat message handling with moderation functionality
  * Actions required:
    - Extract moderation functionality to `ModerationService.ts`
    - Keep core chat functionality in ChatService
    - Update imports in related files
  * Complexity: Medium

- [ ] 7. Refactor `src/services/kick/WebhookService.ts`
  * Current line count: 227
  * Issues:
    - Mixes webhook registration with event handling
    - Contains event emitter logic that could be separated
  * Actions required:
    - Extract event handling to `WebhookEventHandler.ts`
    - Keep registration/CRUD operations in WebhookService
    - Create a dedicated webhook verification utility
  * Complexity: High

## Code Duplication and Patterns

- [ ] 8. Standardize error handling across services
  * Issues:
    - Inconsistent error handling patterns
    - Duplicate try/catch blocks with similar logic
  * Actions required:
    - Create a unified error handling decorator or higher-order function
    - Apply consistent error handling pattern across all services
    - Update all service methods to use the standardized approach
  * Complexity: Medium

- [ ] 9. Standardize authentication handling
  * Issues:
    - Repetitive access token validation
    - Inconsistent auth parameter handling
  * Actions required:
    - Create an authentication utility or middleware
    - Standardize auth parameter format across all services
    - Update service methods to use the standardized approach
  * Complexity: Medium

## Poor Separation of Concerns

- [ ] 10. Refactor `src/utils/cache.ts`
  * Current line count: 102
  * Issues:
    - Mixes caching logic with cache invalidation strategies
    - No clear separation between in-memory and persistent caching
  * Actions required:
    - Split into `inMemoryCache.ts` and `persistentCache.ts`
    - Create a common cache interface
    - Extract cache invalidation strategies to separate utility
  * Complexity: Medium

- [ ] 11. Refactor `src/mcp/handler.ts`
  * Issues:
    - Likely contains mixed responsibilities for handling MCP requests
    - May have grown too large with multiple handler types
  * Actions required:
    - Split into domain-specific handlers
    - Create a handler factory or registry
    - Implement consistent request validation
  * Complexity: High

## Progress Tracking Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: As you complete each refactoring task:
1. Mark the item as complete by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in the checklist
2. Document any additional issues discovered during refactoring as new checklist items
3. Save the checklist file after each update to maintain an accurate progress record
4. Use this checklist during team reviews to communicate progress

## Refactoring Guidelines

When performing refactorings, please follow these principles:
- Extract cohesive pieces of functionality into separate components
- Maintain existing prop interfaces and data flow
- Ensure all functionality continues to work as expected
- Use consistent and meaningful file naming conventions
- Create appropriate folder structures for related components
- Group related functionality in logical folders
- Update imports/exports without breaking existing references
