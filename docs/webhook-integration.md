# Kick API Webhook Integration Guide

This guide provides detailed information on integrating with Kick's webhook system for real-time notifications.

## Overview

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications when events occur on Kick. Instead of polling the API for updates, webhooks push data to your application as events happen.

## Supported Events

Kick supports the following webhook events:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `stream.online` | Triggered when a channel goes live |
| `stream.offline` | Triggered when a stream ends |
| `follow` | Triggered when a user follows a channel |
| `unfollow` | Triggered when a user unfollows a channel |
| `subscription` | Triggered when a user subscribes to a channel |
| `subscription.end` | Triggered when a subscription expires |
| `chat.message` | Triggered when a chat message is sent |
| `donation` | Triggered when a user donates to a channel |

## Webhook Registration

To receive webhook events, you need to register a webhook endpoint with Kick.

### Prerequisites

1. A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint that can receive POST requests
2. A Kick API client ID and secret with appropriate permissions
3. A valid access token with webhook management permissions

### Registering a Webhook

```typescript
const webhook = await kickClient.webhook.registerWebhook({
  access_token: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  url: 'https://your-server.com/webhook',
  events: ['stream.online', 'stream.offline', 'follow'],
  secret: 'your-webhook-secret' // Used for signature verification
});
```

### Managing Webhooks

```typescript
// Get all registered webhooks
const webhooks = await kickClient.webhook.getWebhooks({
  access_token: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
});

// Update a webhook
const updatedWebhook = await kickClient.webhook.updateWebhook({
  access_token: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  webhook_id: 123,
  events: ['stream.online', 'follow'],
  status: 'active' // or 'disabled'
});

// Delete a webhook
const result = await kickClient.webhook.deleteWebhook({
  access_token: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  webhook_id: 123
});
```

## Webhook Payload Structure

When an event occurs, Kick will send a POST request to your registered webhook URL with a JSON payload. The payload structure varies depending on the event type, but all payloads include these common fields:

```json
{
  "event": "stream.online",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T12:34:56Z",
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

### Example Payloads

#### Stream Online Event

```json
{
  "event": "stream.online",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T12:34:56Z",
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "channel_id": 123456,
    "user_id": 789012,
    "title": "Playing Fortnite!",
    "category_id": 33,
    "category_name": "Fortnite",
    "started_at": "2023-06-15T12:34:50Z"
  }
}
```

#### Follow Event

```json
{
  "event": "follow",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T12:45:30Z",
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "channel_id": 123456,
    "user_id": 345678,
    "username": "new_follower",
    "followed_at": "2023-06-15T12:45:28Z"
  }
}
```

## Webhook Security

To ensure that webhook requests are coming from Kick and not a malicious third party, Kick signs each webhook request with a signature. You should verify this signature before processing the webhook.

### Signature Verification

Kick includes a `Kick-Signature` header with each webhook request. This header contains a HMAC SHA-256 signature of the request body, using your webhook secret as the key.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { KickClient } from 'kick-api-client';

const app = express();
const kickClient = new KickClient();

app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  // Get the signature from the headers
  const signature = req.headers['kick-signature'];
  
  // Get the raw request body
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  
  // Your webhook secret from registration
  const secret = 'your-webhook-secret';
  
  // Verify the signature
  const isValid = kickClient.webhook.verifyWebhookSignature(
    signature as string,
    payload,
    secret
  );
  
  if (!isValid) {
    console.error('Invalid webhook signature');
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // Process the webhook event
  const event = req.body.event;
  console.log(`Received ${event} event:`, req.body);
  
  // Process the event using the WebhookService
  kickClient.webhook.processWebhookEvent(event, req.body);
  
  // Always respond with 200 OK to acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server listening on port 3000');
});
```

## Event Handling with WebhookService

The `WebhookService` provides an event-based system for handling webhook events:

```typescript
// Register event listeners
kickClient.webhook.on('stream.online', (payload) => {
  console.log('Stream went online:', payload);
  // Send notification, update database, etc.
});

kickClient.webhook.on('follow', (payload) => {
  console.log('New follower:', payload);
  // Update follower count, send thank you message, etc.
});

// Listen for all events
kickClient.webhook.on('all', ({ event, payload }) => {
  console.log(`Received ${event} event:`, payload);
  // Generic event logging or processing
});

// One-time event listener
kickClient.webhook.once('subscription', (payload) => {
  console.log('New subscription:', payload);
  // Handle the first subscription event only
});

// Remove event listener
const followHandler = (payload) => {
  console.log('New follower:', payload);
};

kickClient.webhook.on('follow', followHandler);
// Later, when you want to stop listening
kickClient.webhook.off('follow', followHandler);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Respond Quickly**: Webhook endpoints should respond within a few seconds to avoid timeouts.

2. **Verify Signatures**: Always verify webhook signatures to ensure requests are legitimate.

3. **Process Asynchronously**: Acknowledge receipt immediately, then process the webhook data asynchronously.

4. **Handle Duplicates**: Implement idempotency to handle potential duplicate webhook deliveries.

5. **Implement Retry Logic**: If your endpoint is temporarily unavailable, Kick will retry delivery with exponential backoff.

6. **Monitor Webhook Health**: Regularly check that your webhooks are receiving events as expected.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Not Receiving Webhooks

- Verify your webhook URL is publicly accessible
- Check that your server is properly configured to accept POST requests
- Ensure your webhook is registered with the correct events and has 'active' status
- Check server logs for any errors in processing webhook requests

#### Invalid Signature Errors

- Verify you're using the correct webhook secret
- Ensure you're verifying the signature against the raw request body
- Check for any middleware that might modify the request body before verification

#### Rate Limiting

If you receive a high volume of webhook events, you might encounter rate limiting. Consider:

- Implementing a queue system to process events
- Filtering events to only receive those you need
- Optimizing your webhook handler for performance

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of a webhook server using Express:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { KickClient } from 'kick-api-client';
import { createServer } from 'http';

// Initialize the Kick client
const kickClient = new KickClient();

// Create Express app
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Webhook endpoint
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  // Verify signature
  const signature = req.headers['kick-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const secret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET || 'your-webhook-secret';
  
  const isValid = kickClient.webhook.verifyWebhookSignature(
    signature as string,
    payload,
    secret
  );
  
  if (!isValid) {
    console.error('Invalid webhook signature');
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // Process the webhook event
  const event = req.body.event;
  console.log(`Received ${event} event:`, req.body);
  
  // Process the event
  kickClient.webhook.processWebhookEvent(event, req.body);
  
  // Acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

// Register event handlers
kickClient.webhook.on('stream.online', (payload) => {
  const { channel_id, title, category_name } = payload.data;
  console.log(`Channel ${channel_id} went live with "${title}" in ${category_name}`);
  
  // Example: Send notification to Discord
  sendDiscordNotification(`ðŸ”´ Channel is now live: ${title} (${category_name})`);
});

kickClient.webhook.on('follow', (payload) => {
  const { channel_id, username } = payload.data;
  console.log(`${username} followed channel ${channel_id}`);
  
  // Example: Update follower count in database
  updateFollowerCount(channel_id);
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const server = createServer(app);

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Webhook server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

// Example helper functions
function sendDiscordNotification(message: string) {
  // Implementation to send notification to Discord
  console.log(`Discord notification: ${message}`);
}

function updateFollowerCount(channelId: number) {
  // Implementation to update follower count in database
  console.log(`Updating follower count for channel ${channelId}`);
}
```
